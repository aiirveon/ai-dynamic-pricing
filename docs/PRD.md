# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## AI Dynamic Pricing for UK Coffee Shops

**Author:** Ogbebor Osaheni  
**Date:** November 2025  
**Status:** Portfolio Project → Production-Ready Concept  
**Target Market:** UK Independent Coffee Shops (500-5,000 transactions/month)

---

## Executive Summary

UK coffee shops lose an estimated £2-4k monthly in revenue by using static pricing that ignores demand signals. This AI-powered dynamic pricing system adjusts prices in real-time based on weather, time-of-day, and product type to capture willingness-to-pay during high-demand periods while maintaining customer trust through explainability.

**Key Metric:** 8-12% revenue lift without customer churn (validated via backtest simulation)

---

## 1. Problem Statement

### 1.1 Business Problem
Independent UK coffee shops face margin pressure from rising costs (rent, labor, ingredients) but hesitate to raise prices due to customer sensitivity. Static menus leave money on the table during peak demand (cold rainy mornings, 8-9 AM commute) while potentially overcharging during slow periods.

### 1.2 User Pain Points

**Coffee Shop Owner:**
- "I know customers will pay more on cold mornings, but I can't change menus daily"
- "My POS system doesn't support time-based pricing"
- "I'm worried dynamic pricing will upset loyal customers"

**Operations Manager:**
- "How do I explain price changes to baristas?"
- "What if customers complain about different prices?"

**Finance Director:**
- "How do I justify dynamic pricing to franchisees?"
- "What's the ROI vs. risk of customer backlash?"

### 1.3 Market Opportunity
- **Target Market:** 25,000 independent coffee shops in UK
- **Addressable Segment:** 5,000 shops with digital POS systems
- **Revenue Potential:** £2k-£4k additional monthly revenue per shop
- **Total Opportunity:** £10M-£20M annual revenue lift (at 5% penetration)

## 2. Solution Overview

### 2.1 Product Vision
An AI pricing engine that runs in the background, recommending optimal prices based on contextual signals, with full explainability for every recommendation to build stakeholder trust.

### 2.2 How It Works

**For Coffee Shop Owners:**
1. Integrate via API with existing POS system
2. System learns from 6-12 weeks of historical transaction data
3. Receives hourly price recommendations via dashboard
4. Can accept, reject, or modify recommendations
5. Views impact reports (revenue lift, customer satisfaction)

**Technical Architecture:**
- XGBoost model trained on historical transactions + weather data
- SHAP explainability layer for every price recommendation
- Confidence scoring (High/Medium/Low) guides manual override decisions
- Backtest engine validates recommendations before deployment

### 2.3 Key Differentiators
1. **Explainability-First:** Every price change comes with a "because..." explanation
2. **Human-in-the-Loop:** Owners control final pricing decisions
3. **UK-Specific:** Weather integration via Open-Meteo API (London focus)
4. **Ethical Design:** No surge pricing on essentials; caps at +15% above base price

## 9. Ethical Considerations

### 9.1 Fairness & Bias
- **Concern:** Algorithm could discriminate based on proxy variables (e.g., location as proxy for demographics)
- **Mitigation:** SHAP audit for protected attributes; monthly bias testing; exclude location-based features in v1

### 9.2 Transparency
- **Concern:** "Black box" pricing erodes customer trust
- **Mitigation:** SHAP explanations for every price; public FAQ on website; "Why this price?" button in app

### 9.3 Consumer Protection
- **Concern:** Surge pricing on essentials could harm vulnerable customers
- **Mitigation:** Price caps (+15% max); no dynamic pricing on basic items (filter coffee stays fixed); low-income discount program

### 9.4 Responsible AI Checklist (Completed)
- ☑ Model explainability implemented (SHAP)
- ☑ Bias audit conducted (no demographic proxy features)
- ☑ Human oversight required (owner approval loop)
- ☑ Data privacy compliant (GDPR Article 22)
- ☑ Rollback plan (can revert to static pricing in <1 hour)

## 10. Open Questions & Future Roadmap

### 10.1 Open Questions (Needs Research)
1. What's the optimal price change frequency? (Hourly? Daily? Dynamic throughout day?)
2. How do customers perceive "fair" price variation? (Survey needed)
3. Which product categories have highest price elasticity? (A/B test needed)
4. Can we predict foot traffic using Google Maps API? (Prototype needed)

### 10.2 Future Features (Post-MVP)
- **V2:** Personalized pricing (loyalty members get stable prices)
- **V3:** Competitor price monitoring (adjust based on nearby cafes)
- **V4:** Inventory-aware pricing (discount items expiring soon)
- **V5:** Predictive ordering (suggest inventory purchases based on forecasted demand)
